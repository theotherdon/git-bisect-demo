# Git Bisect Demo

This repo contains the example project used in the git bisect video demo [here](https://youtu.be/KKScRdC7uHI?si=STf7hu4Vcvfep2FG). A more detailed breakdown of git bisect can be found [here](https://medium.com/@donaldschrimsher/how-i-use-git-bisect-to-quickly-find-the-cause-of-a-regression-749d2fc373fe).

## Setup
To get things setup, simply pull down the repo and run `yarn` to install the dependencies. Once that's done, you should be good to go.
